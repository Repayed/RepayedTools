A plugin which allows the server to have multiple tools. It's currently in the works and the only available tool is an Explosive Pickaxe.
I think it's a pretty cool plugin because it has allowed me to learn a couple of things.

As I said, this is very incomplete, but I'll be working on it in the following days.

Known Bugs:
Basically since the way that I'm checking to see if the item used in mining is just by checking the material and display name. If on a server there was an item 
rename plugin or something. It could be heavily abused. I'm looking to hopefully learn better ways of doing this soon.

The explosive pickaxe isn't exacly breaking a 3x3x3. One of the reasons is because I'll have to change the X,Y,Z to the different ways a player could be facing when mining.
